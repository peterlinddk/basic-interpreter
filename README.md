# A BASIC interpreter

This is an experiment in writing an interpreter for the BASIC programming language, 
without much preparation or knowledge about interpreters.

And just to make everything harder, I've decided to write it all in C - however I have opted for using C23 and many of its modern features.

I plan to learn as I go along, and be prepared to make large refactorings, or possibly
rewrites, as I learn better ways of doing things. In reality I do know about parsers, 
lexers, compilers, regular expressions, BNF grammars and a lot more, but I do not want
to pretend to be an expert, so I develop everything iteratively, as needed.
